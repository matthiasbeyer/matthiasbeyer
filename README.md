### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer from Germany, working in Rust for my private projects
and in Bash/Python/C++ in my dayjob.
I am a Linux professional, certified LPIC1 and looking forward to get my LPIC2
soon.
I have skills with various deployment systems, programming languages and other
linux-based tools (see below).

I enjoy all kinds of music, hiking and boardgames in my freetime.

#### I am proud of

* [imag](https://sr.ht/~matthiasbeyer/imag/) a personal-information managment suite for the linux commandline
* [toml-query](https://git.sr.ht/~matthiasbeyer/toml-query) a XPath-like Rust library for the TOML format
* Some more [rust crates](https://crates.io/users/matthiasbeyer)
* My skills with
  * git, bash, vim, make, the linux commandline, but also
  * abstract thinking,
  * divide-and-conquer-style problem solving
  * getting a deep understanding of a problem before deciding on a solution
