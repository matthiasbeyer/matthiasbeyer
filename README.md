### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer from Germany, working in Rust for my private projects
and in Bash/Python/C++ in my dayjob.
I am a Linux professional, certified LPIC1 and looking forward to get my LPIC2
soon.
I have skills with various deployment systems, programming languages and other
linux-based tools (see below).

I enjoy all kinds of music, hiking and boardgames in my freetime.
